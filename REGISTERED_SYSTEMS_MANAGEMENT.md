## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What Gets Deleted

When you delete an agent, the following are **permanently removed**:

1. ✅ Agent registration record
2. ✅ All network monitoring logs for that system
3. ✅ All website usage data for that system
4. ✅ System heartbeat history

### What Doesn't Get Deleted

- ❌ User account (only the agent association)
- ❌ Other systems registered by the same user
- ❌ Historical reports already generated

### Security

- 🔒 Only **admin users** can delete agents
- 🔒 Requires valid authentication token
- 🔒 Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- 🔒 Full audit logging in backend console

---

## 📊 Backend Logs

### When Deleting an Agent

```
🗑️ Network Monitoring - Delete agent request: {
  systemId: 'sys-1760618858733-3x0gc5dbs',
  requestedBy: 'admin@portal.io',
  role: 'admin'
}
🗑️ Deleted 42 network logs for system sys-1760618858733-3x0gc5dbs
✅ Agent deleted: byline23 (sys-1760618858733-3x0gc5dbs)
```

### If Agent Not Found

```
❌ Agent not found: sys-nonexistent123
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Backend Implementation

**Route Handler:**
```javascript
router.delete('/agents/:systemId', protect, authorize('admin'), async (req, res) => {
  // 1. Find agent
  const agent = await SystemAgent.findOne({ systemId });
  
  // 2. Delete all network logs
  const deletedLogs = await NetworkMonitoring.deleteMany({ systemId });
  
  // 3. Delete agent
  await SystemAgent.deleteOne({ systemId });
  
  // 4. Return success
  res.json({ success: true, deletedLogs: deletedLogs.deletedCount });
});
```

### Frontend Implementation

**Delete Handler:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteConfirm = async () => {
  try {
    await deleteAgent(agentToDelete.systemId);
    setDeleteDialogOpen(false);
    fetchData(); // Refresh
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error deleting agent:', error);
    alert('Failed to delete agent');
  }
};
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Remove Decommissioned Computers

When an employee's computer is replaced:
1. Delete old agent registration
2. Employee re-registers new computer
3. Clean data for accurate reporting

### 2. Clean Up Test Agents

During development/testing:
1. Multiple test agents registered
2. Delete test registrations
3. Keep only production agents

### 3. Remove Duplicate Registrations

If same computer registered multiple times:
1. Identify duplicate system IDs
2. Delete old/inactive registrations
3. Keep most recent active agent

### 4. Employee Departure

When employee leaves company:
1. Delete their registered agents
2. Remove all associated monitoring data
3. Maintain data privacy
