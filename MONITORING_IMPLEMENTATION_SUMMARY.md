## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Update .env with monitoring API key
echo "MONITORING_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here" >> .env

# Start the server
npm start
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Agent Setup

```bash
# Navigate to agent directory
cd agent

# Install (Linux)
./install.sh

# Or install (Windows)
install.bat

# Edit configuration
nano config.json  # or notepad config.json on Windows

# Run agent
./venv/bin/python3 monitoring_agent.py
```

## 📝 Configuration Files

### Backend
- `backend/.env` - Add `MONITORING_API_KEY` and `LOCAL_JWT_SECRET`

### Agent
- `agent/config.json` - Configure backend URL, API key, polling interval, monitored directories

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Data Retention**: Old telemetry data is auto-deleted (30 days for processes/files, 15 days for network)
2. **Scalability**: Current implementation is suitable for up to ~100 hosts
3. **Network Monitoring**: Limited to 50 connections per collection to avoid performance issues
4. **File Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring requires configured directories (not automatic)

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Advanced analytics and trend visualization
- Custom alert rule builder
- Email/SMS notifications
- Agent auto-update mechanism
- Multi-tenant support
- Export reports to PDF/CSV
- Advanced network traffic analysis
- Integration with external monitoring tools

1. `MONITORING_MODULE_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
2. `agent/README.md` - Agent-specific guide
3. Backend logs - Check console output
4. Agent logs - Check `monitoring_agent.log`
5. Browser console - Check for frontend errors
